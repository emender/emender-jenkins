Emender-Jenkins Interface
-------------------------
Emender-Jenkins Interface is a software component designated to control how
Emender jobs are created, changed and possibly deleted in selected Jenkins
server. Basically, Emender-Jenkins Interface communicates with other external
components:

. Control application that displays nice and consistent user interface and allows users to work with Emender tests and test results indirectly.
. Jenkins server (via its API).
. Git repositories.

Emender-Jenkins Toolchain
-------------------------
[NOTE]
Technically it is possible to create fully functional documentation testing
toolchain w/o the need to use Emender-Jenkins, but the user experience is not
optimal.

The basic documentation testing toolchain contains three components:

. Git server (with document repositories, see below)
. Jenkins server (runs jobs automatically or manually, see below)
. Emender and its libraries, setup as 'special' Jenkins jobs

The *emend* command line tool is called by Jenkins job to run tests against selected document.

Proposed workflow
-----------------
. Three jobs are configured for each document: test Preview, test Stage, test Production.
. Jenkins calls these jobs according to its setup or according to calls made via Emender-Jenkins interface.
. Each job calls *emend* (via CLI) to produce test results.
. Test results are stored as artifacts.

Emender-Jenkins Interface API
-----------------------------
Emender-Jenkins Interface is controlled exclusively via REST API. This
API is described in the document *rest_api.adoc*. Basic supported operations:

Jobs CRUD:
* create new job (that calls Emender)
* read job config
* update job (reconfigure)
* delete job

Other calls:
* start job
* enable job
* disable job
* get list of all jobs
* get job results
