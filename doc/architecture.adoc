Emender-Jenkins Interface
-------------------------
Emender-Jenkins Interface is a software component designated to control how
Emender jobs are created, changed and possibly deleted in selected Jenkins
server. Basically, Emender-Jenkins Interface communicates with other external
components:

. Control application that displays nice and consistent user interface and allows users to work with Emender tests and test results indirectly.
. Jenkins server (via its API).
. Git repositories.
